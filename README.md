# About Us

<hr style="height: 3px">

<span style="font-size: 15px"> 

[OplnCo](https://opinco.vercel.app/) previously known as Devstucom represents Open Inclusive Collaborative. We as a community help our fellow students build skills
through direct discussions and urge individuals to contribute to open source, and we welcome every geek to collaborate and contribute with us to this journey of knowledge.
Our vision is to build a holistic platform for young minds to socialise and learn about the evolving world of technology and cultivate a sense of community spirit.

The recent event organized by the community was [#FrontendDaysDurg](https://frontenddays.events/event/frontend-days-durg/), and we are celebrating Open Source with
[HacktoberWeek](https://github.com/OpInCo-Community/HacktoberWeek/tree/bd5077ca41fff8a78b6966f14695ddabc4a6a982).
